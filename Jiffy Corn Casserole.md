# Jiffy Corn Casserole
> Made this for the first time for our 2018 mini-Thanksgiving as an alternative to the Swiss corn bake. Brittany really loved it. It was easy and good. Could become a staple. #easy #Thanksgiving #cast-iron #bake

## Ingredients
- Jiffy Corn Muffin Mix | 1 box |
- Butter | 1 stick | melted
- Creamed Corn | 1 small (8.75 oz) can |
> or half a regular-size can
- Corn | 1 small (8.75 oz) can | drained
- Sour Cream | 1 cup |
- Eggs | 2 | beaten
- Cheddar Cheese | 6 oz | Shredded

## Directions
Preheat oven to 375-degrees. 
Add the butter and both types of corn to a 1.5 quart casserole dish or a 12-inch cast iron skillet; stir together. 
Add sour cream and eggs; stir again. 
Add the Jiffy mix and stir again until you have a visually uniform mixture. 
Top the whole thing with the shredded cheese; cover loosely with foil. 
Bake until set in the middle (about thirty minutes); remove foil for final few minutes to ensure the cheese browns. 
Let cool for about five-minutes; cut into squares or slices and serve.
