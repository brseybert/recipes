## Ingredients
Butter (unsalted) | 6 T |
Flour | 1 1/2 cups + 3 T | divided
Chicken broth | 1 1/2 quarts (48 oz) |
Leftover Gravy | 1 cup | optional
Onion | 1 large |
Carrots | 2 medium | chopped
Celery | 3 medium | chopped
Leftover chicken or turkey | 1 lb | torn into bite-sized pieces
Frozen Peas | 1 1/2 cups | thawed
Parsley | 1/2 cup | minced
Salt & Pepper
Baking Powder | 1/2 tsp |
Fresh Chives | 2 T | minced
Buttermilk | 1/2 cup |
Egg | 1 |

## Directions
Heat 3 T butter in a large dutch oven or saucepan over medium-high heat until melted. Add 3 T flour and cook, stirring constantly, until pale golden brown, about 3-minutes. Slowly whisk in broth. Add gravy, onions, carrots, and celery. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are softened, about 10-minutes. Stir in turkey, peas, and half of parsley, and season to taste with salt & pepper. Remove from heat. 
Melt remaining 3 T butter. Combine remaining 1 1/2 cups flour, baking powder, chives, remaining parsley, and 3/4 tsp kosher salt in a medium bowl. 
Combine buttermilk, eggs, and butter in a second bowl. Pour buttermilk mixture over flour mixture and stir with a wooden spoon until it forms a shaggy (!) dough. 
Return stew to a bare simmer. Using a tablespoon measure, drop dumping dough in 1-inch balls over surface of stew. Cover and cook until dumplings have puffed and feel firm to the touch and a toothpick inserted into the center of one comes out clean, about 15-minutes. Serve immediately.
