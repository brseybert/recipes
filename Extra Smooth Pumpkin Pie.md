# Extra Smooth Pumpkin Pie
> It’s pretty good if you’re looking for a change from regular pumpkin pie. I prefer a more traditional recipe, but this is a nice change of pace. #dessert #thanksgiving #pie

## Ingredients
- [Easy Pie Dough](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2011/07/easy-pie-dough-recipe.html) | 1/2 recipe |
- Sugar | 6 oz |
- Salt | 1/2 tsp |
- Cinnamon | 1 tsp | ground
- Ginger | 1 tsp | ground
- Nutmeg | 1/2 tsp | grated
- Cream Cheese | 8 oz | at room temperature
- Pumpkin Puree | 1 can (15-ounce) |
- Unsalted Butter | 4 T | melted and cooled
- Eggs | 3 | large

## Directions
Adjust oven rack to lower middle position. Place a heavy duty rimmed baking sheet on the rack and preheat oven to 425-degrees
Roll pie dough into a circle roughly 12-inches in diameter. Transfer to a 9-inch pie plate. Using a pair of kitchen shears, trim the edges of the pie dough until it overhangs the edge of the pie plate by 1/2 an inch all the way around. Fold edges of pie dough down, tucking it under itself, working your way around the pie plate until everything is well-tucked. Use the forefinger of your left hand and the thumb and forefinger on your right hand to crimp the edges. 
When oven is ready, line chilled pie shell with foil or parchment paper and fill with weights (you can use dried beans for this), transfer pie to the preheated baking sheet and bake for 15-minutes. Remove weights and liner, turn pie, and bake until the bottom crust is a golden brown, about 10-minutes. Remove pie shell from oven and allow to cool completely. 
Reduce heat to 350-degrees. In the bowl of a food processor, combine sugar, salt, cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg and pulse 3-times to mix. Add the cream cheese and pulse until a homogenous paste forms. Add the pumpkin and butter and process for 30-seconds. Stop to scrape down the sides of the bowl, then process until the mixture is completely smooth, about 30-seconds longer. Add the eggs and process until completely smooth, scraping down the sides as necessary. 
Pour the mixture into prepared pie shell and smooth over the top with a rubber spatula. Rap the shell firmly against the counter a few times in order to release any air bubbles. Transfer pumpkin pie to the baking sheet in the oven and bake until the filling puffs slightly and the center only moves slightly when jiggled, 30-to-35-minutes, rotating the pumpkin pie half-way through baking. 
Allow the pie to cool for at least one hour before serving. 
> This pie may be chilled for up to two days.
