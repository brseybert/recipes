# 50 Stars BBQ Chicken
> I’m not kidding when I promise you this will be the best Barbecue Chicken you will ever taste. I can’t claim the recipe, it was gleened from my friend Marcy Kee, who is FAMOUS in our town for her cooking and smoked meats.

## Ingredients

- 1 Bottle of Sweet Baby Rays Barbecue Sauce
- 1 Stick of Butter 
> don’t be scared, good food is made this way
- 2 packets of Italian Seasoning  
	Dash of Basil
- 14 Chicken Drumsticks

## Directions
  
Preheat Oven to 350. 
> you will use grill a little later
  
In a large saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Wisk in Italian Seasoning, Basil and Bottle of Barbecue Sauce. Bring to a Boil.
Dip Drumsticks generously into sauce mixture and place in a 9x13 pan
> There should be a good amount left over for later
Bake in the oven for 30 minutes and Preheat Grill on Medium Low half way during baking process.
Remove Drumsticks from oven (your house will now smell amazing), and give them one last dunk in the barbecue sauce and place them on heated grill. 
Grill for an additional 15-20 minutes. I like them just slightly charred.
## Notes  

> You can fully cook the chicken in the oven if you prefer not to grill, just increase baking time to 45 minutes or until chicken is done.

Hot Wing Variation  
Add 1 Bottle of Hot Sauce  
Use Wings instead of Drumsticks
