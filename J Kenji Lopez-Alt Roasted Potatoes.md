## Ingredients
- Salt
- Baking Soda | 1 tsp. |
- Russet or Yukon Gold Potatoes | 4 lbs | peeled and cut into bite-sized pieces
- Extra Virgin Olive Oil | 5 T |
- Rosemary | | Chopped
- Garlic | 3 cloves | minced
- Freshly ground black pepper 
- Parsley | | Minced

## Directions 
Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat to 450 degrees
Heat 2 quarts water in large pot over high heat until boiling; add 2 T salt, baking soda, and potatoes; stir. Return to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook until a knife meets little resistance when inserted into a potato chunk, about 10-minutes after returning to a boil. 
Meanwhile, combine olive oil with rosemary, garlic, and a few grinds of black pepper in a small saucepan and heat over medium. Cook, stirring and shaking pan constantly until garlic just begins to turn golden, about 3-minutes. Immediately strain oil through fine mesh strainer into a large bowl. Set garlic/rosemary mixture aside and reserve separately. 
When potatoes are cooked, drain carefully and let rest in the pot for about 30-seconds to allow excess moisture to evaporate. Transfer to bowl with infused oil. Season to taste with a little more salt & pepper, and toss to coat, shaking bowl roughly until a thick layer of mashed-potato-like paste has built up on the potato chunks. 
Transfer potatoes to a large rimmed baking sheet and separate them, spreading them out evenly. Transfer to oven and roast, without moving, for 20-minutes. Using a thin, flexible metal spatula to release any stuck potatoes, shake pan and turn potatoes. Continue roasting until potatoes are deep brown and crisp all over, turning and shaking a few times during cooking, 30-to-40-minutes longer. 
Transfer potatoes to al large bowl and add garlic/rosemary mixture and minced parsley. Toss to coat and season with more salt & pepper to taste. Serve immediately.
